# ML conference analysis

This repository is for analysing code release trends from NeurIPS 2019.

In future, it may extend to other analysis.

## Caveats

### NeurIPS 2019 code release

The analysis is imperfect. Some papers (104 out of 1428) don't make it all the way through the pipeline due to a missing file, failed text conversion or uncommon formatting. Some text information fails to be extracted correctly or detected at all. At a higher level, the analysis overlooks underlying factors that influence the decision to release code.

## Installation

See `environment.yml` for dependencies. The main ones are

- `python >= 3.6`
- `scrapy`
- `nltk`
- `scikit-learn`
- `spacy`
- `allennlp`

`bash code_release_pipeline.sh` will run the full pipeline necessary to reproduce the analysis of NeurIPS 2019 code release. Getting the data and doing named entity recognition take a long time, so in practice you may want to run the steps separately.
